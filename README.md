We'll build on the transfer learning example in [TensorFlow for
Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/)
to illustrate how new object classes can be introduced and learned iteratively,
with the learner following an active learning strategy, and with input provided
by a human trainer.
